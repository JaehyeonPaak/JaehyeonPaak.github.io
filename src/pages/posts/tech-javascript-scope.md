## Why I chose GitHub Pages
Commonly known blogging platforms for developer include **Medium** and **WordPress**. These platforms make posting relatively easy but have limitations when it comes to customization.   
  
Especially if you're an independent person and don't want to rely on third-party blogging platforms, I recommend **GitHub Pages**, where you can implement everything directly. 

To be precise, it is static site hosting service that allows you to run files through GitHub repositories and display websites.  

In short, GitHub Pages is the website provided by GitHub. All you have to do is just upload the files to run your own website.  

Let's take a look at some advantages of GitHub Pages 
##### 1. Free Hosting (unless files exceed 1GB)  
##### 2. Custom Domain
##### 3. Automatic Deployment

**Then why not Next.js but Gatsby?**  
The purpose of these two frameworks are different. **Next.js** is primarily used for server-side rendering communicating with the server and dynamically generates the website with each request.  

On the other hand, **Gatsby is used for static site generation without a server.** It is commonly used for services like blogs, portfolios, and company website.

Here is the list of the advantages of Gatsby.
##### 1. It's React based framework  
##### 2. It's freely customizable  
##### 3. Support markdown
